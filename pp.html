<h1>Randy Huynh</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph, now the things I want to include is links to all my pages and to do that Imma need to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make the page look better</li>
    <li>Responsive Design</li>
    <li>Complete links with seperate pages for each.(like a page that has all the links i.e. staging area) </li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a quick link to <a href="https://github.com/rhuyu" target="_blank">Github</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhuynh0/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> profiles since I feel like we can use these later.</p>

<h3>Day 2 of Coding</h3>
    <p>Mostly just learning how to implement css into my html by linking it into the head of the document. Which we did successfully cuz I have a brackgorund color for my h1 element! Not else has changed but I suppose it would be nice to just snip the part of code that i did change and just store it for later. Gotta defintely look into getting how to get the code snap to wrap my text I was thinking of using the p tag but idk that just looks like a lot of p tags and I didn't want to split up a paragraph</p>
    <p>I also think it's good practice so heres my img so far but it's way too big rn but ima fix it l8r</p>
